        I am Jee-do Galakpai Gbozee Arkoi; My Parents are Rev. Augustine S. Arkoi of Ziggidda, Zozzor District, Lofa County, Liberia & Mrs. Rita E. Arkoi of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo. <br>
        I have really been contemplating on whether or not I will decide to be a Liberian when I reach the age of 18 (Eighteen), but I am currently trying to do some research on DRC and then I will confirm that I am giving up on this place called Liberia.

        I am Interested in Contributing to My Environment through Technology to the Best of My Ability, therefore, I wish to put in more work to improve my ability/skills and be able to make more impact and fulfill My Purpose of Creation. <br>
        As a Young Guy growing up, especially while using Microsoft Office, I would really admire <b>Bill Gates</b>. He has been a very big part of my motivation in pursuing technology as a career. <br>
        I also know that <b>One-Day, I will Develop Something that the Entire World will use and be able to appreciate it!</b>
